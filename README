Email obfuscator for PHP.

Simplifies obfuscation of arbitrary UTF-8 strings in a way that
makes it easy to descramble them client-side using Javascript.
In order to force misbehaving harvesters to make additional request,
obfuscated data is actually encrypted with XXTEA block cipher and
only random seed is published together with it.  Encryption key is
securely derived from that seed and server's secret and it's revealed
on subsequent request. 

To simplify usage, klg/obfuscator also includes simple Twig extension
which provides "obfuscate" and "deobfuscate" filters as well as
"obfuscator.seed" and "obfuscator.key" variables.  The last one is
and array of 32-bit integers (128-bit) and shall never be sent along
the obfuscated data.
